  exhibitDescription: "Mystical signs inlaid with gold bedeck the magnificent hilt
    of the Langeid sword \u2013 a Viking weapon infused with Christian symbolism
    and laid in a pre-Christian grave while the new faith was conquering the last
    regions of Norway. It is still a mystery as to exactly what the symbols on the
    sword\u2019s hilt tell us. Many of them clearly bear a Christian message with
    different variants of the cross. The Latin letters are among the most complex
    to interpret, but one may suspect that they are meaningful abbreviations with
    a Christian message."
