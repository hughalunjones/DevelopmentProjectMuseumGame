  exhibitDescription: Ancient Egyptian pottery served as household wares for the
    storage, preparation, transport, and consumption of food, drink, and raw materials.
    Such items include beer and wine mugs and water jugs, but also bread molds, fire
    pits, lamps, and stands for holding round vessels, which were all commonly used
    in the Egyptian household. Other types of pottery served ritual purposes. Ceramics
    are often found as grave goods.
