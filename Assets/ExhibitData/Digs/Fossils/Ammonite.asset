  exhibitDescription: Ammonites were shelled cephalopods that died out about 66 million
    years ago. These fossils are found all around the world, sometimes in very large
    concentrations. Ammonites came in a range of sizes, from just a few millimetres
    to 100 times bigger, with larger sizes more common from the Late Jurassic onwards.
    Because they are so common and evolved so rapidly, they are helpful in determining
    the age of the rocks they were fossilised in.
