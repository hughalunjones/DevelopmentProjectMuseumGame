  exhibitDescription: 'The oldest known corals lived during the Cambrian, more than
    500 million years ago, and are still found living today. Some, like octocorals,
    are soft bodied and rarely preserved as fossils, but others secrete a hard calcarous
    skeleton and are thus important rock-forming organisms. '
