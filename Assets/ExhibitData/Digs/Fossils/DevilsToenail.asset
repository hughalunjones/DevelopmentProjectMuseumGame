  exhibitDescription: "Fossilised oyster shells, known as Gryphaea or \u2018devil\u2019s
    toenails\u2019, are common at many locations along the West coast of Scotland.
    These now-extinct, distinctive bivalves are well-preserved in Lower Jurassic
    limestone rock formations across the UK, as their thick calcite shells are capable
    of surviving weathering and erosion."
