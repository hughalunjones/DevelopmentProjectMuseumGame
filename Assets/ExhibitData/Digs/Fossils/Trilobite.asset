  exhibitDescription: Trilobites rank among the most important of early animals.
    Our knowledge of them has been gained from the study of their fossils, usually
    impressions left of their shells after burial in sediment which subsequently
    hardened into rock. Trilobites were arthropods like many invertebrate animals
    living today, including crustaceans, spiders and insects.
