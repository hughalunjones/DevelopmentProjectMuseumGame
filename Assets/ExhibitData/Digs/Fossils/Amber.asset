  exhibitDescription: Amber is fossilized tree resin that has been appreciated for
    its color and natural beauty since Neolithic times.  Because it originates as
    a soft, sticky tree resin, amber sometimes contains animal and plant material.
    Much valued from antiquity to the present as a gemstone, amber is made into a
    variety of decorative objects.
